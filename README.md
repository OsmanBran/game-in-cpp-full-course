# Game In C++ Full Course
  
Forked this from a C++ game course while trying to learn C++ more.

Implemented a rogue-like game structure where you can choose upgrades on each level.

New features I added:
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Upgrade system between levels.
- Visual upgrades for the ship.
- Scoring mechanism and menus.

Learnt stuff like:
- how to use openGL to render graphics and menus.
- Cmake libraries and set ups.
- Game loop structure.

I'm going to pause this for now and start a new project because the greatest limitation is that this project does not use classes.
It means adding code is pretty messy and harder to create appropriate separations.
